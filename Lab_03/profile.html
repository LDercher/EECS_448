 <p class="secondclass">My name is Luke Dercher. I've been and done a lot of things in my 29 yrs of life. I spent 5 yrs in the US Navy. While I was enlisted in the Navy I went to Navy Dive School,and I managed the rebuilding of a delapedated school building for the people of a third world country called East Timor.  After my enlistment I attended the University of California State Channel Islands, where I started on my bachelor's in computer science. Shortly after that I decided to move back to my home state of Kansas and finish my degree at the University of Kansas. I am currently in my junior year of my computer science program at the University of Kansas.</p>

 <p>Here is a list of my favorite websites.</p>
<table>  
  <tr>
	<th><a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a></th>
    <th><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">W3schools</a></th>
    <th><a href="https://code.org">code.org</a></th>
    <th><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td>Stack overflow is a website with where programmers post solutions to programming problems. It is every programmer's friend.</td>
	<td>W3schools.com is a great resource for someone who is beginnning to learn web developement. I've been using it heavily lately to learn to make my website and for projects I've been working on</td>
	<td>This website has various games and tools to teach children computer science which I think is important. I think understanding technology will become increasingly important in the future</td>
	<td>Github is a tool to use for programmers to collaborate on projects. It is very useful for helping teams of programmers to work on a single project.</td>
